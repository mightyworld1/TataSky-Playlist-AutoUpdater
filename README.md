Now you don't need to touch anything, It updates the playlist on its own every day and you only need to Update the playlist in Tivimate.

## Note:

* In case you changed your Tata Sky Password, You need to run this script again.
* Make sure you've given the necessary permissions for GitHub Token.
* In case you upgraded your DTH Plan and would also want to reflect it into your playlist, Then you might need to run this script again.

## Explanation on how this works

This works purely on the basis of GitHub Workflow Actions, So a VERY BIG THANKS to GitHub.
I've created the script where Actions will automatically trigger the workflow every day for 2:30 AM IST.

The tokens, GitHub Email, and ID are required because we are basically creating another repo and gists with this script using them.
